<h3>Platform vendor</h3>
<p>Technical knowledge of your LTI Advantage platform vendor required.</p>
<p>Consult your LTI Advantage documentation from your Platform.</p>
<p>The platform vendor points to the key in an LTI Advantage request that contains the session data from that vendor. This is used to identify the user making a request.</p>
<p>This is a unique key that will be related to the Platform vendor and looks like a URL.</p>
<p>An example of this key is presented in the <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/v1p3/#examplelinkrequest" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LTI Advantage documentation here</a>. In this example the key would be "<code>http://www.ExamplePlatformVendor.com/session</code>".</p>
<p>If your platform vendor is not in the list select 'Other' and enter the value provided by your platform.</p>

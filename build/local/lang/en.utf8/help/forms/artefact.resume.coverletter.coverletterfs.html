<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
<p>This optional section is a positive and concise summary of between two and five sentences or bullet points. It gives a broad overview, highlighting what you are looking for and your skills, knowledge and experience related to the position. It is often the hardest section to write. If your profile does not add value to your CV, leave it out.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Your CV may only have 20-30 seconds to make an impression and so a good, well
  written profile is essential. Be sure that your profile is focused and doesn't waffle
  or become irrelevant.&quot;</em> Mike Minnis, STR Group Training Academy</p>

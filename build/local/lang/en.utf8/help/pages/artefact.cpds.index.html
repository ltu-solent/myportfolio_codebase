    <div class="help_text">The CPD tool (Continued Professional Development) is very much like a logbook. In it you can record hours that you have spent on a specific task such as volunteering, coaching or personal development training.   It's to help you keep track of your progress and to record highlights of   what went on. You can have as many CPD   logbooks as you like.</div>

    Just click on the 'New CPD' button on the right and decide what you will   be using it for. You then will have to give it a title and description,   press save, then start adding your content. This will all be private   until you display  them on a page and then publish or share that page.</div>

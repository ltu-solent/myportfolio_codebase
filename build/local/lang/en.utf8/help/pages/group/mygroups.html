    Anyone in myPortfolio can create a group for whatever purpose they want; study group, special interest group, or for a project. Within groups you can work on pages together, discuss topics in your own forum, and store files. Your groups can also be private invites only, or open to anyone at Solent. On this page you'll see a list of groups that you're part of and button that allows you to create a group.

		This page lets you search for users to add as friends. Depending on their settings, you may be automatically accepted as their friend or you may need to send a request. Some users may not allow friendship requests at all.  When sending a friendship request, you can choose to include a short message introducing yourself. This is especially important if you have a display name set as others will not see your real name.

        The journal tool  allows you to keep note of your thoughts and reflections over a period of time.  With each post you can attach a document, image or any other file you wish. You  can have more than one journal (check your settings) and all journals are  private until you display them on a page and then publish or share that page.

        Setting up your journal is easy. If you can't see the 'Create Journal'   button on the right then you'll need to switch to 'multiple journals'. Go   to your <a href="http://myportfolio.solent.ac.uk/account/" target="_blank">settings</a> and select 'multiple journals'. Once you've done that you can create a journal and add entries.
